# Automatic Refinements and Polynomial-Time Reductions in Isabelle/HOL
This repository sets out to formalize some classic results about NP-completeness in Isabelle/HOL.

## Using

The theories in this repository are developed with the current development version of [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) and the [AFP](https://www.isa-afp.org/download/).

For checking and browsing the theories, the following additional sessions are needed:
- [ML-Typeclasses](https://github.com/kappelmann/ml-typeclasses-isabelle): make it available in the same way as the AFP, i.e., with `isabelle components -u /path/to/ml-typeclasses`.

When you start Isabelle, you have to include this repositories ROOTS file.
